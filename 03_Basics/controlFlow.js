// Control flow of how things are executed 
// two phases: - memory / creation phase (only allocates memory) - execution phase 

// JS exeution context : shows how JS EXECUTES YOUR CODE 
// two types:

// GLOBAL EC : always made when start execution, stores in this, diffeent for all browsers 

// FUNCTIONAL EC : 

// EVAL EC : 

// overall process: 
// 1. Makes a Global EC allocated to this
// 2. Memory Phase(first cycle) - takes names of all variables and placed unefined in them 

// val1 => undefined 
// addnum -> definition (this is a function, and it stores all the logic/ definition inside it)

// execution phase - store the values and then executes
