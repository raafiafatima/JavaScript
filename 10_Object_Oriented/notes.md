# JAVASCRIPT AND CLASSES 
Does JS has classes - YES and NO 
in short, JavaScript is fundamentally a prototype-based language, where objects can directly inherit from other objects without using class-based inheritance like in Java or C++.

While JavaScript introduced class syntax in ES6 (2015), itâ€™s actually just syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based system.
So, although it looks like JavaScript has classes, under the hood it still uses prototypes for inheritance and behavior sharing.

## OOPS 

## Object 
- collection of properties and methods 
- toLowerCase() => an object

## Why use OOP
remove sppghetti code 

## Parts of OOP 
Object Literal -> literally an object 

- Constructor Functions 
- Prototypes 
- Classes 
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars 
- Abstraction // example - fetch()
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism // one method doing many works
