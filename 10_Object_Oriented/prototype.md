# PROTOTYPES IN JS 
- JS has a prototypal behaviour where it keeps going to all the parent elements to find a behaviour and doenot stop until it gets a null value 

- we dont get this in arrow functions because of prototype
- Prototype gives us classes, rhis, and inheritance 
- Prototypal inheritance

- everything is an object, such as 
- array -> object -> null 
- stirng -> object -> null (getter and sette available )
- function can also be made to behave like an object, it can allow the dot syntax to attain some properties etc
